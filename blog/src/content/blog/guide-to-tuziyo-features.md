Welcome to **Tuziyo**, your new go-to destination for fast, secure, and intelligent image editing. In a world where online privacy is scarce, we built Tuziyo with a single promise: **Your photos never leave your device.**

Whether you're a content creator, a developer, or just someone looking to fix up a family photo, Tuziyo offers a suite of professional-grade tools right in your browser.

Here is a complete guide to what you can do with Tuziyo.

## 1. AI Inpainting: The Magic Eraser

Have a perfect shot ruined by a photobomber, a stray trash can, or a watermark? Our AI Inpainting tool uses advanced machine learning models (running locally in your browser!) to seamlessly remove unwanted elements.

**How to use it:**
1. Navigate to the **Inpainting** tool.
2. **Upload** your image.
3. Use the **Brush** tool to paint over the object you want to remove. You can adjust the brush size for precision.
4. Click **Remove**. The AI will analyze the surrounding pixels and fill in the gap intelligently.
5. **Download** your clean image.

## 2. Batch Format Converter

Stop struggling with incompatible file formats. Tuziyo's Converter allows you to transform images between modern and classic formats in seconds.

**Supported Formats:**
- Inputs: HEIC, PNG, JPG, WEBP, AVIF
- Outputs: PNG, JPG, WEBP

**How to use it:**
1. Go to the **Convert** page.
2. Drag and drop **one or multiple images**.
3. Select your desired **Output Format** (e.g., WebP for web performance, JPG for compatibility).
4. Click **Convert All**. Since it processes locally, it's lightning fast!

## 3. Smart Resize

Need to shrink photos for a website or email attachment? Our Resizer lets you scale images down (or up) while maintaining quality.

**How to use it:**
1. Open the **Resize** tool.
2. Upload your images.
3. Choose your method:
    - **By Percentage**: e.g., reduce to 50%.
    - **By Dimensions**: Set a specific Width or Height (aspect ratio is preserved automatically).
4. Hit **Size Image** and download the optimized files.

## 4. Professional Crop

Get your images ready for Instagram, X (Twitter), or your blog header with precise cropping tools.

**How to use it:**
1. Head to the **Crop** tool.
2. Upload a photo.
3. Choose a **Preset Ratio** (like 1:1 Square, 16:9 Landscape) or drag the handles for a **Freestyle** crop.
4. Confirm and download.

## Why Choose Tuziyo?

### 🔒 Privacy First
Most online tools upload your photos to a cloud server to process them. This poses a privacy risk. **Tuziyo processes everything locally using WebAssembly and WebGPU technology.** Your personal photos stay on your computer, always.

### ⚡ Blazing Speed
No uploading implies no waiting. Large files open instantly, and processing happens as fast as your device allows.

### 💸 100% Free
We believe essential tools should be accessible to everyone. No paywalls, no hidden fees.
